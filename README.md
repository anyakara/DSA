# Data Structures & Algorithms Implementation & Analysis

## Data Structures
Culmination of common data structures and algorithms for usage in development of software for high-performance compute, operating systems logic, database systems with efficient information retrieval. Purpose of this repository is to keep notes of efficient alternates for the different tasks of computers.

* **Singly, Doubly, Circular [Linked List](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linked_list)**: useful for dynamic memory management and in the implementation of queues and stacks, used in hardware for managing hardware tasks and processing data.
* [**Graph**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_(abstract_data_type)):
Used extensively in hardware environments for circuit design, simulating components including logic gates, registers, and memory elemnents, while edges represent connections between the components. These data structures are put to use by graph algorithms, which are employed to optimize the layout, reduce power consumption and performance of the circuits.
* **[Binary Tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_tree#:~:text=In%20computer%20science%2C%20a%20binary,child%20and%20the%20right%20child.)**: Represent hierarchical structures, such as memory hierarchies, search trees for optimizing algorithms, and organizing data in parallel processing architectures.
* **[Hash Table](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_table)**: Used to implement associative arrays and used for caching, indexing and acceleration of data access.
* **[Matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_(mathematics))**: Represent data in multi-dimensional spaces, such as in image processing, linear algebra operations, and neural network computations.
* **[Priority Queue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Priority_queue)**: Utilized in hardware for tasks like scheduling and resource allocation, where the order of processing tasks is based on certain priority criteria.
* **[Tries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trie)**: Used for efficient string storage and retrieval, which is important in hardware for tasks like pattern matching and data compression.
* **[Bloom Filters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloom_filter)**: Probabilistic data structures used for set membership testing and are useful in hardware for tasks like caching and filtering.
